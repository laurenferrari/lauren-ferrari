            <p>
My name is Lauren Ferrari, I am currently a Junior at Millersville University. I am a full time student working towards receiving my Bachelors in Interactive and Graphic Design. In my free time, I do freelance work for various clients, including designing logos for companies and illustrating custom tattoo artwork. Outside of school and my design work, I enjoy activities such as hiking, cooking, crocheting, playing the ukulele, etc. I love trying new things everyday and going on spontaneous adventures!

            <h1>design</h1>
          <p>
            Some of my favourite design classes I have taken during my time at Millersville are Material Design, Package Design, Illustration, and Typography. Other design classes I am taking this semester currently are Intro to Computer Art and Visual Communications ll. I decided to take this class because I have always struggled with web design and coding, by taking this course I hope to get a better understanding of web development has whole to improve the skills I need to become a better designer.

      <p>
        After I leave Millersville University with a Bachelor of Design, I plan on either going for an apprenticeship to become a professional tattoo artist or going into material and product design. I also enjoy User Experience and User Interface design and would love to explore those particular fields of design as well!
